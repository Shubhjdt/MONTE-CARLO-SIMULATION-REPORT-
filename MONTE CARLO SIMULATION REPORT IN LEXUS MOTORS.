🚗📊 **Monte Carlo Simulation for Lexus Business – Report & Insights**

I recently completed a project applying **Monte Carlo Simulation** to analyze business uncertainty for a Lexus unit.

🔹 **Key assumptions**:

* Revenue \~ Uniform(5M – 12M)
* Costs \~ Normal(mean = 7.5M, std = 1.2M)
* Target Profit % Range: 15% – 25%

🔹 **Highlights from the simulation (50,000 trials)**:

* 📈 Mean Profit: \~ **0.99M**
* 📊 Mean Profit %: **6.08%**
* ⚖️ Probability of achieving target profit %: **15.74%**
* ⚠️ Probability of loss: **35.97%**

This project demonstrates how **probabilistic modeling and risk analysis** can provide deeper business insights compared to single-point forecasts.

I’ve included the **full report with Python code and visualizations** to make the analysis reproducible and transparent.

👉 Excited to apply such methods to real-world business problems in data science and financial modeling!
